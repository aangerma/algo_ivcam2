This document documents a major code cleanup performed during FOVex integration.
The cleanup focuses on parts concerned with geometric transformations, and is aimed at simplifying code trackability and reduce probability of errors.

1. Adding FOVex application after each time laser outbound direction is calculated using oXYZfunc, except for functions describing Pipe flow.
   Changes were made in the following functions:
    * Calibration.aux.ang2vec
    * Calibration.aux.guardbandFromPixel
    * Calibration.aux.vec2xy
    * Calibration.aux.xy2vec
    * Calibration.roi.calibROI.vec2xy
    * Pipe.CBUF.FRMW.xy2ang
    * DEST.FRMW.trigoCalcs
   Changes were NOT made in the following functions:
    * Calibration.aux.ang2xySF
    * Calibration.aux.xy2angSF
    * Pipe.DIGG.FRMW.getAng2xyCoeffs
    * Pipe.DIGG.ang2xy
   
2. Replacing old applyExpander with new applyFOVex, and removing all references to expander LUT.
   Changes were made in the following functions:
    * Calibration.runCalibStream
	* Calibration.aux.ang2vec
	* Calibration.aux.ang2xySF
	* Calibration.aux.calibDFZ
	* Calibration.aux.vec2ang
	* Calibration.aux.zoLoc
	* Calibration.aux.CBTools.spherical2xySingle
	* Calibration.roi.calibROI
	* Calibration.roi.ROI_calib
	* Calibration.thermal.collectTempData
	* Calibration.Undist.calibPolinomialUndistParams
	* Calibration.Undist.calibUndistAng2xyBugFix
	* Calibration.Undist.generateUndistTablesFromGridPointsOnly
	* Calibration.validation.calculateFOV
	* Calibration.validation.validateFOV
	* Pipe.bootCalcs
	* Pipe.CBUF.FRMW.preCalcs
	* Pipe.DEST.FRMW.preCalcs
	* CompiledAPI/ROI_Calib_Calc
	* CompiledAPI/TemDataFrame_Calc
	* scripts/IV2calibTool/calibParams*
	
3. Removing multiplicity of geometric transformation functions (for Pipe use Pipe.DIGG.ang2xy or ang2xySF etc., otherwise use ang2vec+vec2xy etc.).
   Changes were made in the following functions:
   * Calibration.aux.CBTools.spherical2xySingle
   * Calibration.aux.ang2xySF
   * Calibration.aux.samplePointsRtd
   * Calibration.aux.xy2angSF
   * Calibration.aux.zoLoc
   * Calibration.roi.calibROI
   * Calibration.thermal.applyFix
   * Pipe.CBUF.FRMW.preCalcs
   * Pipe.DEST.FRMW.preCalcs
   The following unused functions were deleted:
   * Calibration.aux.applyFOVexOnOutVec
   * Calibration.DFZ.errFunc

4. Changes were made in autogen-related functions (Pipe.XXX.FRMW) - Hila to be informed
